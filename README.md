#rentcafe

Project Goal: 

Create a Wordpress plugin that allows for clients that are RentCafe users to download a plugin that pulls in property data from RentCafe and displaly it in the same format as the link here http://www.rentcafe.com/apartments/wa/seattle/circa-green-lake-apartments/floorplans.aspx

Currently, the data is being pulled into the plugin and we just need to do the following. 

1. Make it dynmic. 40 different apartments will be uploading the plugin and all have different floorplan types. So, we need the table to displaly appropriate tabs (e.g. Studio, One Bedroom, 2 Bedroom 2 Bath or for a different apartment One Bedroom, Two Bedroom). 
2. Style the table to look like http://www.rentcafe.com/apartments/wa/seattle/circa-green-lake-apartments/floorplans.aspx with tabs vertical to the left, the middle section has floorplan name, availability and table details and far right has a photo of the floorplan. As a screen shrinks, these tabs become collapsible
3. Create shortcode so once a property/company code is entered, an apartment manager can drop the shortcode into their pages and it will display the table. 
4. Not sure on this, but I am assuming a filter like in the example I provided would be great as well. 

I am using MaterializeCSS for the plugin

Let me know if you have any questions.
